- Why is initialValue a generator and not a constant (dimension)
- db.database -> ugly
- does extend belong to dimension?
- ext2int in analytics?
- change on row and columns but not for measures
- enter this.status='planned' into filter field -> eval sets value and changes data
-support tab

x   import
x   export
x   pivot in pivot
x   rename dimensions
